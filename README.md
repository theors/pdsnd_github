### Project Title
**Bikeshare Data script**

### Description
*In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I write code to import the data and answer some interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.*

### Files used
* new_york_city.csv  
* washington.csv  
* chicago.csv
